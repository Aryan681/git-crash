-> we can firstly ( init) the git then 

-> Then use git add . to add all the file to the tracking .

-> Then use git commit -m "message" to commit the file to the local 
repository .

-> Then use git push origin master to push the file to the remote repository .

-> we can see commits using the git log .

-> we can also see the commit line by  line using the git diff .

-> we can also see the status of the file using the git status .

-> to quite the git log we press q.

-> u--> Unchecked , a--> checking , m --> modifies

-> we used the git staged , when the change done but not commits

->  the step for the commit is that :-
 Step 1: local storage
 Step 2: staging area    
 Step 3: commit

-> git show commit_id , show us all the changes happen in the file .

-> git blame file_name  it shows that who changes the code and when .


Note : make the commit clean , mean do a one thing then commit , it make the tracking easy.

-> commit is like the link list , so the head is point toward the latest commit .

-> if there was the error commit in the log and we have to revert then we can use[ git reset --hard commit_id].

-> if we want to revert the particular commit then we use [git revert  commit_id]

-> to connect our local file to the center server like the gitHub 
we use [git remote add origin (server name {can be any thing ,default is origin repo address (from git hub)})] 

-> by using git push -u origin main , we add our changes to the repo.
