-> we can firstly ( init) the git then 

-> Then use git add . to add all the file to the tracking .

-> Then use git commit -m "message" to commit the file to the local 
repository .

-> Then use git push origin master to push the file to the remote repository .

-> we can see commits using the git log .

-> we can also see the commit line by  line using the git diff .

-> we can also see the status of the file using the git status .

-> to quite the git log we press q.

-> u--> Unchecked , a--> checking , m --> modifies

-> we used the git staged , when the change done but not commits

->  the step for the commit is that :-
 Step 1: local storage
 Step 2: staging area    
 Step 3: commit

-> git show commit_id , show us all the changes happen in the file .

-> git blame file_name  it shows that who changes the code and when .


Note : make the commit clean , mean do a one thing then commit , it make the tracking easy.

-> commit is like the link list , so the head is point toward the latest commit .

-> if there was the error commit in the log and we have to revert then we can use[ git reset --hard commit_id].

-> if we want to revert the particular commit then we use [git revert  commit_id]

-> to connect our local file to the center server like the gitHub 
we use [git remote add origin (server name {can be any thing ,default is origin repo address (from git hub)})] 

-> By using git push  origin main , we add our changes to the repo.

->the real process to push in to the repos is :-
Step 1: Fetch and Merge the Latest Changes
        First, fetch the latest changes from the remote repository,Then, merge the changes into your local branch:

                        git fetch origin
                        git merge origin/main

Step 2: Push Your Changes
        git push origin main


-> We can have the multiple remote , it is basically use in the open Source

Note: git pull do fetching and merging same time, while git fetch has   separate .

BRANCHING 
-> Branching is a way to work on a feature independently of any other work. It allows you to create a new line of development from an existing.

-> we can create the branch using the git branch branch_name

-> we can switch to the branch using the git checkout branch_name

-> we can delete the branch using the git branch -d branch_name

-> we can merge the branch using the git merge branch_name

-> we use the [git push --set-upstream branch_name subbranch_name] to push the subbranch in the main branch .

-> how to merge the new branch in the main branch of the remote server :-

CLI Method (command line interface)
Step 1 : go to main branch 
Step 2 : git merge origin/Sub_branch_name
Step 3 : git push

Naming Of Branch :-
wip       Works in progress; stuff I know won't be finished soon
feat      Feature I'm adding or expanding
bug       Bug fix or experiment
junk      Throwaway branch created to experiment

Example=> "feat/add-the-chat-support"

git checkout -b feat/add-the-chat-support
