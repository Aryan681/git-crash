we can firstly ( init) the git then 
Then use git add . to add all the file to the tracking
Then use git commit -m "message" to commit the file to the local repository
Then use git push origin master to push the file to the remote repository
we can see commits using the git log
we can also see the commit line by  line using the git diff
we can also see the status of the file using the git status
to quite the git log we press q.
u--> Unchecked , a--> checking , m --> modifies
we used the git staged , when the change done but not commits
 the step for the commit is that 
 1. local storage
 2. staging area
 3. commit
  git show commit_id , show us all the changes happen in the file .
  git blame file_name  it shows that who changes the code and when .
